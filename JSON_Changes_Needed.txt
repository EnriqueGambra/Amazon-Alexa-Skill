Changes need to be made to the JSON file in order for utterances to make more sense,
these utterances aren't grammatically correct:
1) research day for no classes 
2) martin luther king jr. day for no classes
3) last day to add an independent study/internship for spring 2020
4) commencement -- ??? I don't know if we should change this...
5) memorial day for no classes
6) first day of classes for summer i 2020 -- should be changed to "first day of classes for summer first term 2020
7) last day to add a course for summer i 2020
8) last day to drop a course for summer i 2020
9) last day to withdraw from a course for summer i 2020
10) last day of classes for summer i 2020
11) independence day (celebrated) for no classes
12) first day of classes for summer ii 2020
13) last day to add a course for summer ii 2020
14) last day to drop a course for summer ii 2020
15) last day to withdraw from a course for summer ii 2020
16) last day of classes for summer ii 2020 and full summer session

Also, we need to change the values within the JSON file that contain the word first and change
it to 1st
